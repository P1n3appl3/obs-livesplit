# OBS LiveSplit Plugin

If you use LiveSplit One and want to show it on stream, but find it annoying to
open a separate window with https://one.livesplit.org or
[livesplit-one-desktop](https://github.com/CryZe/livesplit-one-desktop), then
you can use this OBS plugin which will directly render your splits as a source
in OBS. It supports autosplitters, and live reloading for both the splits and
layout, so you can edit those on the fly without having to reload the plugin or
restart OBS. If you don't use an autosplitter, you can set your hotkeys for
split/reset/etc. under Controls>Settings>Hotkeys (probably at the bottom of the
list).
